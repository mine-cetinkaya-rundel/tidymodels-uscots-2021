## Welcome

- Introductions...
- Useful links

TO DO: Need to update hex for logo for workshop...

class: middle

# High level view: tidymodels

---

## With basic model fit (lm) alone, no advantage

Not necessarily better way to do any linear model, better as a framework in general

---

## 	Syntax side by side, tidymodels more complicated -- debbie

---

## Preprocess training and testing data together, recipes as a big picture

---

## Split into training/testing first

---

class: middle

# Case study 1: Linear, simple...

---

MLR example without recipes

- fit model
- prediction
- breakout room: 10 min
		
---

class: middle

# Case study 2: Logistic, more complex...

---

cross validation, autoplot

---

class: middle

# Wrap up

---

## What about inference?
